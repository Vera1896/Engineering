    <p>Who we are: We are three 7th grade Girl Scout Cadettes from Troop 61192. </p>
    <p>What we are doing is: We are working on our Girl Scout Silver Award Project. The Girl Scout Silver Award Project is a project in which we find the root cause of an issue in our community and try to make a long-lasting solution.</p>
    <p>Why we’re doing this: The issue we are focusing on is that many children think engineering is just computers, and they don’t really know a lot about engineering. We are trying to educate children about engineering.</p>
    <p>How this will help our community: When educating children about engineering, they can figure out their interests, and possibly be interested in engineering, which opens up a lot of job/career opportunities for them in the future!</p>
